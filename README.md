# ü™¥ Coffee Meets Plants ‚òïÔ∏è

#### If you told me two years ago today that I would be a proud plant dad to over 50 plants, I would have laughed in your face. It wasn't until during the pandemic did I discover my green thumb and love for all things related to houseplants. I vividly remember buying my very first houseplant and it was from that moment, a new found love and passion grew. Just as the world was starting to open back up, I found myself discovering a coffee plant shop in New York City on Columbus Ave. called Plantshed. It was in that moment when I knew that one day, I will open my own coffee/plant shop because why not? I love coffee. I love plants. Therefore, the creation of Coffee Meets Plants was born. I hope you enjoy this web app just as much as I had fun building it!
